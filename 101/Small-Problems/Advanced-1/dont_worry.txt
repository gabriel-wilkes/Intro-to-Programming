Here's a little song I wrote 
You might want to sing it |adverb|. 
Don't worry, be |adjective|. 
In every life we have some trouble 
But when you |verb|, you make it double. 
Don't worry, be |adjective|. 

Ain't got no place to |verb| your |noun| 
Somebody came and took your |noun|. 
Don't worry, be |adjective|. 
The landlord says your rent is late 
He may have to |verb| your |noun|. 
Don't worry, ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha 
Be |adjective|. Look at me, I'm |adjective|
